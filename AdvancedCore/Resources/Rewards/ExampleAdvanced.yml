# You can just remove values you don't want (just delete it)
# If you just want money just have a reward file containg only "Money: 100", for example
# Don't use this file as a reward, example only

# This is the advanced example, if you only want an item or command then look
# at the basic example, you can simply copy and paste from here what you want
# in other reward files, that is the way they are designed
